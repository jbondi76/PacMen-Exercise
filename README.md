<img src= "pacmenthumb.png" width='300'/>
Coding exercise to showcase my ability to manipulate the DOM.

Exercise objective is to create a web page that produces a PacMan with the click of a button using array methods. You can create as many PacMen as you wish and each PacMan will have a random position and velocity.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE EXERCISE: Download the Zip file then be sure to extract all the files. Once extracted, you just need to open the HTML file in your browser. *NOTE - If you have GitHub Desktop downloaded on your device you can open the repository using desktop without the need to extract the files.
